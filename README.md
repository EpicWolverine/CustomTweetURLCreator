Custom Tweet URL Creator
=====================

Create a URL to post a custom tweet on Twitter. Check that the link works as intended, and then shorten it on a site such as http://bit.ly or http://goo.gl. Your link is ready for sharing!

Future Plans
=====================
The core functionality of Custom Tweet URL Creator is complete. Current plans for added features and improvements include (in order of importance):
* An about window
* One click integrated URL shortening support (probably bit.ly or goo.gl)
* More URL safe codes for special characters
